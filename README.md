# Arduboy2-Clock
It's just a cool clock  

Uses Arduboy2 and [emutyworks/8x8DotJPFont](https://github.com/emutyworks/8x8DotJPFont) libraries.  


It's just, a clock.  
You can change the time.  
It, saves it, in EEPROM.  
It even displays seconds.  


The interface is in Japanese because, well, it can be.  
人間は愚か。
